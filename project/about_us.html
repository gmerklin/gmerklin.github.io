<p>Since its debut performance in 1997,  The Seraphim Singers has created a special niche among Boston’s performing elite with sensitive and probing performances of a wide variety of the masterpieces of sacred choral music drawn from the earliest times to the twenty-first century.  Founded and directed by Jennifer Lester, The Seraphim Singers has gathered critical acclaim for its advanced technique and superb sense of style.</p>
<span id="more"><p>
In residence at the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help (known fondly among Bostonians as “the Mission Church”), the ensemble consists mostly of gifted and talented organists, choir directors, composers and other professional musicians whose vast knowledge and experience nourish a passion for arresting and demanding repertoire.</p>

<p>
The Seraphim Singers has honed critically acclaimed, refined and elegant interpretations of sacred masterworks composed over the centuries, from Palestrina, Victoria and Byrd of the Renaissance; Bach, Monteverdi, and Handel of the Baroque; Mendelssohn and Rheinberger of the Romantic; to Widor,  Vierne, Langlais, Copland, and Duruflé of the twentieth century.</p><p>
Committed to the creation and performance of new music, The Seraphim Singers is the recipient of a CANE grant from the Alfred Nash Patterson Foundation and over the years has commissioned many works from a distinguished roster of composers.  Well known for advancing works by local composers, the ensemble has given premiere performances of works by Thomas Bold, Avner Dorman, Elliott Gyger, Graham Ramsay, Eric Sawyer, Julian Wachner and James Woodman, and has recorded choral compositions of Elliott Gyger for the ARSIS Audio label.</p><p>
The Seraphim Singers has participated in programs sponsored by the Boston New Music Initiative, and has also collaborated with Musica Sacra, Cambridge, in a performance of Bach’s Magnificat, and with the Saint Paul Parish Adult Choir, Cambridge, in a performance of Bach’s St. John Passion.</p><p>
By integrating the old with the new,  The Seraphim Singers has consistently brought to light the timeless transcendence inherent in all great sacred choral compositions.</p><p>
